# Happy Unsuspecting Microgrid

This is a side project looking at a simplistic simulation around common micro grid components and their interactions with a larger world.


End objective is to provide people with a number of toggles to see how actual weather, predicted weather, and component failure can lead to flux within the system.

This is a virtual equivalent of a more impressive hardware demo

## Unity Setup
You should be able to import through unity hub. The project solution file will be generated by unity during compile. Depending on your setup, your IDE may not seem to work (ie things like autocomplete, error checking, etc) will not function until this happens

## Git notes for Unity

Ensure that you have installed Git Large File Storage (LFS) found [here](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
