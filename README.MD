# Happy Unsuspecting Microgrid

This is a side project looking at a simplistic simulation around common micro grid components and their interactions with a larger world.


End objective is to provide people with a number of toggles to see how actual weather, predicted weather, and component failure can lead to flux within the system.

This is a virtual equivalent of a more impressive hardware demo
